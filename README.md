# MagicCounterApp

Here is my second project, a “Magic the Gathering” Counter.

As a Magic Player, I have been always looking for ways use an external tool to keep track of the different scores on the game, since using dices, or pen and paper is not really a comfortable solution.
Another important detail, is to be able to keep track of your enemy’s counters, because you do not want to lose a game because of some mistake, that is why I decided to design the layout in a way to allow both players to look at all the scores.
I did not wanted to design a vertical view because when two players are playing facing each other, you want to have a clear look to the counter status of your enemy, and the best place to position my Counter App is on the side of the main battle field.
I am already working on options to be able to change the distribution of the elements, and then provide the user with different layouts that can better adapt to their play style.
As always, you can check the code of my application here.
